Naming is a hard problem--one of the [two hard things](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html) in computer science.  I like to say that naming is impossibly hard.  It suggests that there is no perfectly correct name.  I think this mindset helps me to be more pragmatic when naming things.  Instead of holding out for the perfect name, I settle for a better name.  Though not necessarily forever.  When I return older and hopefully wiser, I may again consider the challenge of finding a better name.

I don't know how I came to like this phrasing.  As I write this, Google only has [three hits for this exact phrase](src/assets/images/google_naming_is_impossibly_hard.png).  The first is by me in [this GitHub comment](https://github.com/elmish/Elmish.WPF/issues/202#issue-598979455), and the third is the same comment on a [copy of GitHub](https://gitmemory.com/issue/elmish/Elmish.WPF/202/613648630).  The second is by [Jeff Atwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood) in [this Stack Exchange comment](https://webapps.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/624/webapps-stackexchange-com-versus-nothingtoinstall-com/664#comment857_652) that predates me by a decade.  I think I am in good company.
