# Technologies

This blog exists because of these wonderful technologies.

## [`coding.blog`](https://coding.blog)

This blog is primarily powered by the [CONNECT-platform](https://github.com/CONNECT-platform).  It is deployed and hosted by [`coding.blog`](https://coding.blog) and most of the markdown features come from [CODEDOC](https://codedoc.cc/).

I was fortunate to be granted early access to `coding.blog`.  If you would like a blog like this, then go [here](https://coding.blog/#how-to-get-there) and join their Prospective Creators List.

Eventually, you can financially support `coding.blog` in exchange for a personally curated content feed.  For now, you can go [here](https://coding.blog/#how-to-get-there) and join their Waiting List for Beta.

## [utterances](https://utteranc.es/)

Support for comments on posts is powered by utterances.  The comments are stored in post-specific issues in this GitHub repo.  Anyone with a GitHub account can add a comment.  If you authorize the utterances bot to post on your behalf, then you can add a comment directly from the post.  Otherwise, you can simply navigate from the post to the backing issue using the provided link and post there yourself.

## GitHub

Of course GitHub also plays a crucial role.  In addition to hosting the comments in select issues, all the content is committed into this repo.  The website is redeployed shortly after `master` is updated.
